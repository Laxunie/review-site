# Postponed
Currently a postponed project as I work on other things.

# About
This project is suppose to be a review site for computer hardware. Users are able to create accounts and review specific parts they may have owned
in the past or currently own. My thought process with this site is for users to share their knowledge and experience with different computer parts.

# Technology
Technology that I plan to use are:

## Frontend
React as it is very easy to navigate through with the seperate components. (And that it is my main frontend framework of choice)

## Database
- MongoDB
For the NOSQL but also complex data structure setup.

## Auth
-Firebase
I like to use Firebase for my auth as it has all the functions built in and there is easy protected routing capabilities.

## Libraries
- React Router
- NodeJS
- ExpressJS
- Axios

#CSS
As for CSS I always choose to use TailWindCSS because of how easy and light weight it is.
